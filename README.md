Hi, my Name is Robert!

I'm quite new to programming and GitHub. This Readme is beeing created to test the funcionality of branches. After this Readme was updated, this branch will be comitted to the master branch. I'm working for a software company and GitHub is a must have because I'm planning to program a lot while beeing at home.
